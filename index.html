            <h2 class="lb=heading">Amiya - The Lord of Fiends</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">The CEO and Figurehead of the pharmaceutical company Rhodes Island. Amiya was orphaned at a young age and left Infected during the incident that killed her parents, luckily she was rescued by The Doctor who then took the young girl under their wing and care for her while traveling the world. Amiya was later raised by Theresa, the leader of Babel and the King of the Sarkaz, after the passing of her maternal figure, Theresa. Amiya would inherit what remained of Babel and create Rhodes Island with the help of Kaltsit. Amiya's mission is to help all the Infected who are ostracized and outcast because of their illness and to create a cure for the infection, Oripathy. Many take her title as the King of Fiends to mean that she will be the prophecized Tyrannical Ruler of the Sarkaz and become the Bringer of the Apocalypse but Amiya is anything but what people believe her to be as she seeks to bring hope and salvation to Terra with her powers regardless of any racial/national/political differences the people she wishes to help may have. Amiya's arts allow her to tap into the emotions of others, have some control over others emotions as well as calling on the powers of the previous Sarkaz Kings.</p>

            <h2 class="lb=heading">The Doctor - The Demon of Babel</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">The Doctor is the enigmatic and elusive Field Commander and Chief Strategist of Rhodes Island. Before they had joined Rhodes Island, they were part of Babel as one of it's core members alongside Kaltsit and it's founder, Theresa. During their time with Babel, the Doctor was recognized for their strategic brilliance and their ability to keep focused on victory even under pressure. Despite this, they were known by many for their empathy and resolve, though others have compared them to a chess player moving pieces to secure victory no matter the cost. The Doctor during this time also began raising Amiya with care and guided her to try and help her find a path of her own despite being left for dead after the attack that killed her parents and left her Infected. The Doctor is also noted to have a humourous and more approachable side as other former Babel members mention having warm and casual conversations with them despite their high position within the organization. The Fall of Babel left the Doctor amnesiac and they were placed into stasis within the Sarcophagus underneath the nomadic city of Chernobog. When they were awoken by Amiya they had no knowledge of their previous actions, life or even who they were but their genius remained and this would mark a new beginning for the Doctor and their journey. Nowadays, the Doctor works with Rhodes Island studying Oripathy aka the infection, training field operators and leading their medical and even paramilitary operations such as field missions despite being frail and a non-combatant, their tactical genius had been too indispensible for Rhodes Island to leave them in their death like sleep in the Sarcophagus despite the many grudges held against them for their mysterious past actions the Doctor doesn't remember. In their spare time they mentor many of the younger members of Rhodes Island as an educator, and outside of commanding battles, they also build diplomatic or commerical relationships with many influential companies and leaders on Terra for Rhodes Island's sake.</p>

            <h2 class="lb=heading">Kal'tsit - Rhodes Island's Unofficial Leader</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Doctor Kal'tsit is one of the top executives of Rhodes Island, Head of the Medical Department, and Amiya's mentor, she is one of the former core members of the now fallen paramilitary organization known as Babel. Kal'tsit has great determination and is seen as an admirable leader, though Amiya is Rhodes Island's leader by right, Kal'tsit as as the unofficial leader and director of the organization in her stead. Kal'tsit can be outright unfriendly, cold and detached but she cares deeply and is willing to make sacrifices to protect the people she cares and sees as important to herself, such as Amiya and the Doctor. Even with her complicated feelings, hatred and the desire to kill as well as mistrust towards the Doctor because of their past actions, she is able to put aside her own feelings to work alongside them to deal with the greater issues and threats at hand. Kal'tsit is accompanied by a creature made from originum named "Mon3tr" at all times, which she uses and commands to provide help for Amiya and the Doctor even at the most critcal and dire of times. Kal'tsit has a long and enigmatic past that is said to be extremely hard to trace back to, it is said that the more attempts to look into her past the more confused they'd become as Kal'tsit can quite literally be seen as history itself as she's witnessed and also been involved in many historic events in shaping of Terra. Kal'tsit has been so many things in the past, a brilliant scientist studying the Sarcophagus, a Leithanien scholar, an advisor and Arts trainer, and even a cleric, she's been there to witness the fall and annhilation of the Empire of Gaul, the Silence of Ibera and the Independance of the country of Columbia. Kal'tsit has lived a long life, and despite it she has never forgotten her goal to lead Terra to cast aside their differences and to guide civilization to new heights.</p>

            <h2 class="lb=heading">Talulah - The Leader of Reunion</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Talulah is the Draco leader of the terrorist organization of Reunion which stands for "the Infected Cause", while she had originally created Reunion to protect the Infected from the suffering, persecution, neglect and abuse she had witnessed they had experienced in Ursus. However, due to a chain of tragic events, Talulah's intent shifts and so does Reunion's methods. Talulah would lead Reunion into becoming more militaristic, she began propogating hate towards the Non-Infected, and advocated for more radical and violent methods for the Infected cause, such as riots, sabotage and acts of terrorism. Talulah is ruthless, cold and callous, she possesses a high amount of charisma which draws people believing in her cause and joining her in her radical methods with the hope of bringing about change. She stands against Rhodes Island and looks down upon them, seeing them as traitors to the Infected and the history of prejudice against them because of their lack of more extreme methods to rally for the Infected's cause, Talulah believes Rhodes Island to have either directly or indirectly enabled their prejudice despite their mission being for the Infected. Talulah has no hesitation for the path she's chosen for herself and the Infected she leads as Reunion, she has chosen to use her inherited fire Arts and her sword to burn down anything and anyone who stands in their path, no matter the cost. Talulah is responsible for so much bloodshed and manipulation, but she will not backdown from her ideals because she is resolved to follow the path she has chosen for herself and Reunion, there is no sacrifice too great to stop her. Talulah and Reunion are the main reason for the Doctor being woken up, and they stand directly in the way of Rhodes Island's ideals and mission as Reunion's extreme methods make the prejudice worse against the Infected.</p>
